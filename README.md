## Stock SD Notice

If you plan to use the firmware package from this repo, it is a good idea to replace the card that came with the M17 with one of your own. A higher-quality SD card will improve system responsiveness and improve loading times. If you use a new SD card, make sure to format the card as 'exFAT' within your operating system. The only thing you should need from the stock card is the `/roms/` folder.
